  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This is the Patient Summary HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for the XpanDH project, created to assist the work of the pilots for the <a href="#adoption-domains">XpanDH exprimentation bubbles</a>.
  </p>

  <a name="project"></a>
  <h3>The project</h3>
  <a name="mission"></a>
  <h4>The mission</h4>
  <p>Help individuals and organizations successfully adopt the European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF) in a way that is empowering and supportive.
  </p>

  <h3>XpanDH Adoption Domains/X-Bubbles</h3>
  <a name="mission"></a>

  <a name="what-is-adoption-domain"></a>
  <h4>What is:</h4>
  <p>An EEHRxF adoption domain could be considered as an instantiation of a use case, with a specific case application, that has meaning from a health system or clinical perspective, with defined implementable requirements (simple if only one EEHRxF priority category is uses or composite if data from more than one is required), that satisfies all the conditions for users to be ready to implement data exchange in conformity to EEHRxF guidelines and specifications 
  </p>
  <p>XpanDH will exercise a set of adoption domains, involving Hospitals, Regional/National organziation, vendors,.., thorugh experimentaion bubbles (in the Hpandh jargon called X-Bubbles)</p>

<!--   <a name="covered-adoption-domain"></a>
  <h4>Adoption domains / X-Bubbles covered by this guide:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>X-Bubble 3: NCZI; organisation to organisation (national). Exchange of discharge reports between different organisations, such as a hospital and a GP or between a hospital local to the patient and a specialist centre treating a disease such as a cancer, in order to enable each clinical actor to be well informed and contribute accurately to the same patient care pathway.</li>
    <li>X-Bubble 4: CHUP; organisation to patient (national. Communicate discharge reports from a hospital to the patient (within the same country) so that they can be informed, raise questions if needed, share this information with other caregivers and take any self-care actions indicated in the report.</li>
    <li>X-Bubble 5: KETEKNY; organisation to national authority.Communicate discharge reports from a hospital to a national authority to support reimbursement decisions or to contribute content to a national registry.</li>
    <li>X-Bubble 6: KETEKNY; national authority to organisation. The national authority communicates discharge reports to a hospital treating a patient, that it has previously received from other hospitals treating that patient, to enable a smooth transfer and continuity of care (e.g. if a patient moves home).</li>
